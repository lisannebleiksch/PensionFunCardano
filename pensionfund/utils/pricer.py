    A class to price financial instruments based on their cash flows, timing, and interest rates.

    This class provides methods to calculate the present value, DV01 (Dollar Value of 01),

    Attributes:
        cash_flows (np.ndarray): Array of cash flow amounts.
        times (np.ndarray): Array of time periods corresponding to each cash flow.
        interest_rate (float): The discount interest rate used for pricing.
