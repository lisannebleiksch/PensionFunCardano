    A class to price financial instruments based on their cash flows, timing, and interest rates.

    This class provides methods to calculate the present value, DV01 (Dollar Value of 01),
    and modified duration of a series of cash flows.

    Attributes:
        cash_flows (np.ndarray): Array of cash flow amounts.
        times (np.ndarray): Array of time periods corresponding to each cash flow.
        interest_rate (float): The discount interest rate used for pricing.
